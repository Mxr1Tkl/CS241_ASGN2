  <h1>Medicinal Plants of the Fijian Seashore</h1>
  <p class="lead">Imagine you’re stuck on an island and the medicine box is empty — here are reliable coastal and near-shore plants used traditionally in Fiji, how locals prepare them, and safety tips.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Quick survival tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify plants carefully — when in doubt, use only external (topical) remedies first (wounds, burns) rather than ingesting anything new.</li>
    <li>Always clean wounds with seawater then fresh water (if available) and use crushed antiseptic leaves as a dressing.</li>
    <li>Small samples first: try a single small amount and wait for allergic reactions before larger use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common coastal medicinal plants (ID, uses, simple preparations)</h2>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Beach almond / <span class="scientific">Terminalia catappa</span></div>
      <div class="howto">Leaves used as a tonic, to soothe coughs, help heal wounds and burns. Leaf juice squeezed into nostrils is traditionally used for headache relief. Fresh leaves can be chewed or made into a mild infusion.</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(coastal ethnobotany, Fiji). </div>
    </div>
    <div>Coastal trees; large pear-shaped leaves</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Guava / <span class="scientific">Psidium guajava</span></div>
      <div class="howto">Young leaves are commonly pounded and soaked to treat diarrhoea and dysentery; leaves can be chewed and their juice swallowed. Also used for mouth rinses and wound cleaning. Avoid eating excessive unripe fruit (can cause stomach upset).</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(widely used tropical remedy).  </div>
    </div>
    <div>Widespread, shrubby tree</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Mile-a-minute / <span class="scientific">Mikania micrantha</span></div>
      <div class="howto">An invasive vine with tender leaves. Leaf juice crushed and applied to bleeding wounds to staunch bleeding and promote clotting. Use fresh crushed leaves as a poultice.</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(local first-aid use).  </div>
    </div>
    <div>Fast-growing vine in disturbed coastal scrub</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Beach hibiscus / <span class="scientific">Hibiscus tiliaceus</span></div>
      <div class="howto">Leaves are applied to sprains and swellings (laid over the affected limb and strapped on). Inner bark fibres used as cordage; leaves can be used as soft dressings for burns.</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(coastal ethnobotany). </div>
    </div>
    <div>Common along shoreline; heart-shaped leaves</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Ageratum / <span class="scientific">Ageratum conyzoides</span></div>
      <div class="howto">Used across Fiji villages for cuts, skin infections and minor wounds; leaves crushed into a paste and applied topically. Ethnobotanical surveys record this as a common everyday remedy island-wide.</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(Gau Island survey & traditional use). </div>
    </div>
    <div>Low herb, found in disturbed coastal areas</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Gotu kola / <span class="scientific">Centella asiatica</span></div>
      <div class="howto">Used as a wound healer and general tonic (fresh leaves chewed or made into poultices). Documented on multiple Fijian islands as a plant used daily for wounds and skin conditions.</div>
      <div class="foot-cite">(documented common use). </div>
    </div>
    <div>Low creeping herb often found in damp ground near shorelines</div>
  </div>

  <div class="plant">
    <div>
      <div class="use">Coastal seaweeds (various species)</div>
      <div class="howto">Several seaweeds (e.g., brown algae and other local sea vegetables) are used as poultices for skin problems and as nutrient-rich broths for convalescence. Rinsing and boiling to make decoctions is common. Note: proper identification is essential — some seaweeds can cause irritation.</div>

    <div>Intertidal rocks, tide pools — collect fresh and rinse well</div>

  <h2>How to prepare & apply — quick recipes</h2>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div>
      <h3>Basic wound poultice</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean the wound with the cleanest water available (seawater then fresh if possible).</li>
        <li>Pick a handful of fresh Ageratum or Mikania leaves, crush in clean hands until juicy.</li>
        <li>Apply the crushed leaves directly to the wound and secure with a clean cloth.</li>
        <li>Change dressing daily; watch for signs of infection (increasing redness, pus, fever).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Diarrhoea infusion (guava)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take 6–8 young guava leaves, rinse, crush lightly and steep in a cup of boiled water for 10–15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain and drink small amounts every few hours.</li>
        <li>Maintain hydration with clean liquids (salt-sugar solution if possible).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> These are traditional emergency remedies — they can help for minor problems but are NOT substitutes for professional care. If you suspect a deep wound, snakebite, severe dehydration, high fever, or broken bone, seek medical attention.</p>

  <h2>Habitat & where to look</h2>
  <p>Most of the plants above grow in coastal belts, dunes, mangrove edges and nearby disturbed ground or village gardens. Beach almond and beach hibiscus are coastal trees; creepers and herbs (Ageratum, Centella) prefer damp ground or areas disturbed by human activity. Seaweeds are collected from intertidal rocks and shallow pools — only harvest from clean water and avoid polluted shores. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</p>

<section>
  <h2>Cautions, allergies & ecological notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Never ingest large quantities of any plant unless its safety is well known — some medicinal plants can be toxic at higher doses or to specific people (pregnant women, infants).</li>
    <li>Avoid plants growing near polluted runoff, roads, or obvious contaminants.</li>
    <li>Respect local customs: many of these plants are part of cultural practice — if you plan to harvest in inhabited areas, ask permission and take only what you need.</li>
    <li>Collect sustainably: invasive species (e.g., Mikania micrantha) can be harvested more liberally, but native species should not be over-harvested. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>After recovery: where to relax (note on Fiji golf resorts)</h2>
  <p>If you’re interested in a comfortable recovery with scenic fairways, several Fiji resorts combine beachside relaxation with golf — popular options include Natadola Bay (InterContinental & Natadola Bay Championship course), Denarau Island resorts and Shangri-La Yanuca Island. These resorts often maintain botanical gardens or cultural programs where you can learn more about local plants and conservation. Use resort facilities for safer, hygienic care after initial field remedies. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>
