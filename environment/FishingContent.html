            <h1><b>iTaukei Fishing</b></h1>
            <h2>Origins of Practice</h2>
                <p>iTaukei fishing traditions are ancient, forming an integral part of their cultural identity and survival for millennia. These practices are rooted in the concept of vanua, which defines 
                the holistic relationship between the people, their spirituality, and their customary fishing grounds (qoliqoli), all aimed at achieving sautu (wellbeing and prosperity). Customary fishing 
                rights are formally recognised in Fiji's Fisheries Act of 1942. This deep historical connection is evidenced by oral traditions‚Äîa 'living archive' of navigation, fishing techniques, and 
                ecological knowledge that predates written records.</p>

            <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <p>A wide array of sophisticated fishing techniques were developed based on profound ecological knowledge. Group fishing was common, with one well-known method being the yavirau, a fish drive 
                using a scareline of vines and coconut leaves to herd fish towards the shore. Another communal method involved using plant-based poisons, such as Derris root (tupa), to stupefy fish in reef pools. 
                Night fishing by torchlight (rama) was also practiced, using torches of coconut spathes to attract fish. Other methods included spearfishing (often with multi-pronged spears), angling with hook 
                and line, and trolling with lures from canoes.</p>

                </p>

            <h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
                <p>The iTaukei employed a diverse toolkit for fishing. Nets (lawa) were fundamental, with a generic term reconstructed to Proto Oceanic being kupena and a specific term for a seine net being pukot. 
                These nets were often used with wooden floats (uto) and stone or cowrie shell (buli) sinkers. Spears (moto) were common, particularly multi-pronged versions like the kujur and tara, used for 
                targeting fish. Basketry fish traps (pupu) and stone fish weirs (bƒÅ) were used to passively catch fish. For angling, they used fishhooks (kawil) made from materials like turtle shell (qunap) and 
                clamshell, attached to a fishing line (apon). They also crafted trolling lures (bayan) from mother-of-pearl.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
                <p>Fishing is of immense cultural significance, providing not only sustenance but also reinforcing social structures and spiritual beliefs. The qoliqoli are prized possessions, and their management 
                is tied to cultural protocols. For instance, a temporary fishing ban, or tabu, is often declared on a section of the qoliqoli following the death of a high chief. This serves as both a mark of 
                respect and a conservation measure, allowing marine ecosystems to regenerate for future ceremonial feasts. The principle of qoli veinanumi‚Äîfishing only for one's immediate needs‚Äîreflects a deep-seated 
                conservation ethic aimed at ensuring sustainability for future generations. This knowledge is guided by the traditional lunar calendar (vula vakaviti), which links ecological cycles, like fish spawning 
                seasons, to specific harvesting activities.</p>

            <h1><b>Indo-Fijian Fishing</b></h1>

            <h2>Origins of Practice</h2>
                <p>Indo-Fijians are descendants of indentured labourers brought from India between 1879 and 1916. Their involvement in coastal fisheries is a more recent development compared to their 
                history in agriculture, with many turning to fishing as an alternative livelihood following the decline of the sugarcane industry. Unlike the iTaukei, they do not hold customary fishing 
                rights and must obtain commercial licenses and seek consent from iTaukei resource owners to access qoliqoli areas. The origins of fishing traditions in the Indian subcontinent can be 
                traced back to ancient civilizations like Harappa, with literary references found in Sangam literature.</p>
                <img src="../images/indo-fijian.jpg" alt="Indentured Labourers who became what is now known as the Indo-Fijians" width="300" height="300">	
            <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <p>Indo-Fijian fishing in Fiji is primarily subsistence and artisanal commercial fishing. Their techniques are based on modern equipment rather than unique traditional methods developed 
                in Fiji. They engage in net fishing and handline fishing, with commercial operators undertaking trips lasting up to a week, while smaller-scale artisanal fishers conduct daily or overnight 
                trips. Some Indo-Fijian women are also involved in capturing mud-crabs, freshwater prawns, and mussels. In the Kerala region of India, traditional fishing communities exchange fish for 
                paddy (rice) and have extensive knowledge of different fish varieties and seasons</p>
                <img src="../images/keralafishing.jpg" alt="Fishing in Kerala" width="300" height="300">	

            <h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
                <p>Indo-Fijian fishers in Fiji typically use modern equipment. Commercial operators often own boats larger than ten metres with powerful engines, equipped with freezers for multi-day trips. 
                Smaller-scale artisanal fishers generally use aluminium or fibreglass punts or half-cabin boats. The primary fishing gear mentioned includes nets and handlines.</p>


            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
                <p>For the Indo-Fijian community in Fiji, fishing is primarily an economic activity and an alternative livelihood, rather than a practice deeply embedded in ancient cultural or spiritual traditions 
                in the same way it is for the iTaukei. Their engagement in the sector is defined by its commercial nature and the socio-political relationships they must navigate with iTaukei communities to gain 
                access to resources. This relationship can be complex, involving informal goodwill payments and negotiations that sometimes lead to feelings of harassment. However, these interactions also foster 
                interdependency. Recent cultural developments, such as the symbolic adoption of Girmitiya descendants into the vanua system, are fostering new social ties that may positively influence these relationships. 
                In India, by contrast, the importance of fish in Bangalee culture can be traced to prehistoric times, with a common saying being mache bhate bangalee (fish and rice comprise Bengalis).</p>
