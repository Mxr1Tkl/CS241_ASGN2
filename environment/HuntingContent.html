	<h1><b>iTaukei Hunting</b></h1>
	
		<h2>Origins of Practice</h2>
			<p>The origins of iTaukei hunting are deeply rooted in their traditional, self-sufficient way of life. For millennia, iTaukei people have thrived in their island environments 
			by utilising a vast and collective knowledge of the land, sky, and sea, passed down through oral traditions like stories and ceremonies. This knowledge allowed for subsistence 
			hunting and fishing, which were integral to their cultural survival. The entire system of food production, including hunting, was based on a holistic worldview of achieving sautu‚Äîa
			state of peace and prosperity between humans and their environment.</p>

		<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<p>Traditional iTaukei hunting methods included the use of traps, snares, or nets set within forest or nature reserves. A significant practice, particularly for wild pigs, involves 
			hunting in groups, often with packs of dogs to track and corner the prey. Another method involved digging a large hole on a game trail and disguising it as a pitfall trap. The initial 
			phase of a battle often began with warriors hurling stones with slings or firing arrows, suggesting these were also used for hunting at a distance before closing in on prey.</p>

		<h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
			<p>The primary hunting tools of the iTaukei included the war club (i-wau), the throwing spear (moto or sa), and the bow and arrow (dakai or vucu). Spears, crafted from dense hardwoods 
			by specialists (matai-ni-moto), could be over three metres long and were sometimes barbed with stingray thorns to make extraction difficult. Bows were typically made from mangrove roots, 
			and arrows had hardwood or fish-bone tips designed to cause infection if not removed. For hunting at a distance, the iTaukei used the i-rabo (sling) to hurl stones. Some spears may have 
			had obsidian heads.</p>

		<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
			<p>Hunting is a culturally significant activity that reinforces the iTaukei connection to the vanua (the land, people, and spirituality). It is intrinsically linked to traditional ecological 
			knowledge, which has enabled iTaukei communities to thrive for generations. The Forest Act 1992 legally recognises and upholds this cultural importance by affirming the customary rights of 
			iTaukei landowners to hunt on their land for domestic purposes. This subsistence practice is not merely for food acquisition but is also part of a wider cultural heritage that ensures the 
			sustainable use of resources, reflecting a deep respect for the environment and ancestral wisdom.</p>

	<h1><b>Indian Hunting</b></h1>
	
		<h2>Origins of Practice</h2>
			<p>Indian hunting practices vary from era to city. However, in India during the Mughal Empire, hunting was deemed a privilege for royalty and viewed as a symbol of masculine power.</p>
		<img src="../images/mughalempirehunting.jpg" alt="Mughal Empire Hunting" width="300" height="300">
		<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<p>Hunting techniques from certain parts and periods of India like  Mughal-era India, involved methods such as forming "hunting circles" (qamarga) to enclose and trap animals, a 
			practice sometimes involving thousands of men to drive the game.</p>
		<img src="../images/qamarga.jpg" alt="Qamarga (Hunting Circles) to enclose prey" width="300" height="300">
		<h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
			<p>Early emperors like Babur used bows and arrows, which were later complemented and often replaced by swords as standard hunting gear. Firearms were introduced for hunting during 
			the reign of Emperor Akbar (1556‚Äì1605). Trained animals, such as hunting cheetahs and hawks, were also used in place of human beaters.</p>

		<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
			<p>Hunting was an avid pastime for emperors, sometimes serving as a form of diplomacy between rulers. The killing of a fat beast was seen as a mark of manliness.</p>
