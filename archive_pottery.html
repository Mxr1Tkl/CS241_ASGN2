        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction & Archaeological Background</h2>
        <p>
          MacLachlan’s work in “The Native Pottery of the Fiji Islands” (1940) provides one of the detailed early 20th-century surveys of Fijian ceramics. His descriptions helped form taxonomies of vessel types, tempering materials, firing methods, and decoration styles used by indigenous potters.  
          Archaeological evidence shows that ceramic tradition in Fiji has roots in the Lapita culture, which arrived around 3,000 years ago; Lapita pottery in Fiji had geometric stamped decoration, tempering with sand or shell, and forms similar to bowls and utility vessels. The Lapita decorative tradition in Fiji gradually simplified over time, giving rise to more plain, functional wares. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

        <h2 class="section-title">Materials, Temper & Clay Sources</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional Fijian pottery uses locally sourced clays, often mixed (tempered) with materials like sand, crushed shell, or fine gravel to reduce cracking during the drying and firing processes. MacLachlan noted that the natural clay alone often lacked strength. Ethnographic sources confirm that temper is critical for durability. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>
        <p>
          The clay is usually gathered from riverbanks or natural clay pits. Sometimes potters walk long distances to find good quality clay with fine particle size. The colour of fired pottery can vary depending on the clay composition and firing atmosphere (oxygen vs. more smoky / reduced conditions). During open firing, areas shielded from flame often turn darker, while exposed surfaces are lighter. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

        <h2 class="section-title">Form, Function & Shapes</h2>
        <p>
          MacLachlan classifies a variety of vessel forms: bowls, cooking pots, storage jars, water containers. Many vessels had wide mouths, sturdy bases, and thick walls, reflecting their practical use (cooking over fire, liquid storage). Decoration was less common on utilitarian wares. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </p>
        <p>
          Among named forms in more recent ethnographic sources:  
          • <em>saqa-moli</em> – a glazed water jar with three conjoined spherical sections (globules), often used for water or ceremonial purposes. In Nasilai, the design of saqamoli was so iconic that it was used on the reverse of the Fijian one-dollar coin. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
          • <em>mua-i-rua</em> – a crescent-shaped pot with a small round opening and flat base. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

        <h2 class="section-title">Techniques: Shaping, Firing, Finishing</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional shaping methods include coil building, paddling, and using stone anvils. A potter may start with coiling clay, then using wooden paddles and stones to shape, thin, and smooth the walls. MacLachlan observed such methods in various districts. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
        </p>
        <p>
          Firing is usually done in open fires (bonfires), often using biomass fuels such as coconut husks, dried wood, shells, or even mangrove twigs. The pot is placed among these fuels and the fire is kept going until the clay is fully fired. The firing atmosphere (smoke, flame exposure) greatly affects final colour and surface finish. After firing, surfaces are sometimes finished with resins or gums (for waterproofing or gloss) or rubbed with plant materials. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

        <h2 class="section-title">Decoration, Motifs & Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
          Decoration styles vary widely by region. Some potters avoid decoration on cooking pots as the smoke or heat can wear it away during use. Where decoration is used, it may be incised, stamped, combed, or applied (raised designs or appliqués). There may also be patterns produced by pressing tools into soft clay. Motifs often include lines, circles, waves, and other geometric or natural themes. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
        </p>
        <p>
          Designs are regionally specific. Simply by seeing the motifs or the “kelukelu” (exterior decorative design), someone familiar with Fijian pottery can often tell the region or village of origin. For example, potters of Nasilai have unique motifs, as do potters from the Sigatoka Valley, Ra, Vanua Levu and other districts. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

        <h2 class="section-title">Socio-Cultural Role & Modern Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Pottery was traditionally made by women, and girls learned the craft from their mothers or grandmothers. In many villages, making clay pots was part of a woman’s cultural duties, especially for making water jars, storage vessels, or cooking pots for family use or communal events. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
        </p>
        <p>
          With changes over time, including the introduction of metal and industrial goods, the traditional demand for clay vessels declined. In response, many potters have turned to tourism or artisan crafts markets. They produce smaller, decorative pieces, miniatures, or glazed pots more suited for display rather than heavy use. These changes affect shape, thickness, decoration, and sometimes choice of materials. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also efforts to preserve and revive ancient practices: in villages such as Nasilai, Naselai, Nakabuta, Lawai etc., elders and potters are teaching younger generations, organizing pottery houses/firing sheds, and seeking support from governmental or non-profit groups. Projects like the “Tuli Tuli” pottery cooking house are examples of heritage preservation initiatives. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

        <h2 class="section-title">Chronological & Archaeological Perspectives</h2>
        <p>
          MacLachlan’s 1940 survey and classification work was among the first comprehensive accounts of Fijian pottery. Later surveys (by Palmer & Shaw, Rossitto and others) refined vessel typologies, decorative styles, and regional differentiations. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeological finds have also discovered that some Lapita-period sherds with the raised-face motif were found in Viti Levu (Natadola Beach area), which connects Fijian pottery heritage to wider Pacific traditions. These finds help trace how designs and forms evolved regionally, including simplification of decoration over time. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
