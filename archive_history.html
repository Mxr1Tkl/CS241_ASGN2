      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Early Settlement and Lapita Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Fiji’s earliest settlers arrived from the islands of <strong>Melanesia</strong> over <strong>3,500 years ago</strong>. 
        These ancient voyagers brought with them a variety of food crops, domesticated pigs, and an advanced pottery tradition 
        known as <strong>Lapita ware</strong>. The Lapita people were highly skilled in navigation and canoe construction, 
        capable of voyaging vast ocean distances.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Archaeologists associate the Lapita culture with early <em>Austronesian-speaking peoples</em>, who spread throughout 
        the Pacific, bringing horticulture, craftsmanship, and seafaring knowledge. From Fiji, this culture extended to 
        <strong>Tonga</strong> and <strong>Samoa</strong>, where the earliest <strong>Polynesian civilizations</strong> emerged.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Cultural Development and Pottery Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Evidence suggests that at least two other pottery styles followed the Lapita tradition in Fiji. 
        However, researchers are uncertain whether these represent major new migrations or localized 
        cultural adaptations brought by smaller migrant groups.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Over time, Fijian pottery evolved in form and decoration, often used for cooking, food storage, 
        and ceremonial functions. Distinctive patterns and designs continue to serve as important symbols 
        of <strong>Fijian heritage</strong> today.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Agriculture and Settlement Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Most early Fijians lived in small, self-sufficient communities near <strong>ridge forts</strong>, 
        practicing a form of <em>slash-and-burn agriculture</em>. They cultivated root crops such as 
        <strong>taro</strong>, <strong>yams</strong>, and <strong>kava</strong>, which remain staples in 
        Fijian diets today.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        In contrast, the fertile <strong>southeastern delta of Viti Levu</strong> supported denser populations. 
        These settlements employed complex irrigation systems for intensive taro farming and were protected 
        by large <strong>ring-ditch fortifications</strong> — a hallmark of early Fijian engineering.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Legacy and Influence</h2>
      <p>
        Fiji’s early societies laid the foundation for a dynamic culture that values community, craftsmanship, 
        and respect for the land and sea. The blending of <strong>Melanesian</strong> and <strong>Polynesian</strong> 
        influences over time produced the unique cultural identity recognized in modern Fiji.
