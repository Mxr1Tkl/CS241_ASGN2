        <p>The first settlements in Fiji were started by voyaging traders and settlers from the west about 3500 years ago. Lapita pottery sherds have been found at Lakeba, Beqa, Natunuka, Naigani and elsewhere. This evidence suggests that the first Fijians had aspects of their culture in common with the people of the western Pacific or Melanesia. Stone <strong>adzes</strong> found in Samoa and Fiji suggest that Fijian culture may also be linked to Samoan culture. As well, huge canoes made from Fiji trees were found in Tonga, and Tongan words are part of the language of the Lau group of islands. Marriage linked many Fijian and Tongan families. Pots made in Fiji have even been found in the Marquesas Islands. For most of its history, across the 1000 kilometres from east to west, Fiji was a nation of many languages; often people were unable to understand the conversations of others. Nothing was static in Fiji. It has a history of settlement but also one of mobility.</p>

        <p>Something special emerged from this early period. Fijians (<em>taukei ni qele</em>) settled and worked the land, and over the centuries a unique Fiji culture gradually developed. This first settler society was made up of many peoples, some staying and some moving to new districts. People cleared the bush, levelled land and made gardens in different ways. New settlers introduced new patterns in Lapita pottery. But gradually the people began to share many aspects of <strong>social organisation</strong>, work organisation, decision making and ceremonial life.</p>

        <h2>Ring-ditches and <em>Turaga</em></h2>
        <img src="turaga.jpg" alt="Fijian Turaga" title="A Turaga in the olden days" width="250" height="300" />

        <p>One historian writing about Fiji used land-use changes in Lakeba in the Lau group to illustrate the progress from early settlement to a highly organised society. In his book, <em>The History of the Pacific Islands</em>, Deryck Scarr states that early settlers grew crops on the hills of Lakeba 3500 years ago. 1500 years later, the valleys were being cultivated. As a result of wars fought about 900 years ago, the Lau Islanders began to build ring-ditches and forts to protect their homes and gardens. This led to a pattern of separate communities or villages across the island.</p>

        <p>Similar changes probably occurred across Fiji. As the population increased and became permanent, a form of social organisation developed ‚Äî the <em>mataqali</em> or family group. Each <em>mataqali</em> was led by a <em>turaga</em> or chief. Land use was decided by the <em>mataqali</em>, or in some parts of Fiji by a smaller group within the village known as <em>i tokatoka</em>.</p>

        <p>On Rotuma, land was under the control of a group. This kinship group shared common ancestors, lived near or on their land, and participated in common activities such as sports, ceremonies or rituals. As in Fiji, the system of land tenure gradually changed over time.</p>

        <p>In the early communities political authority was organised with everyone given a place: chiefs, the chiefs' assistants, speakers and orators, organisers of ceremonies, priests and warriors. Chiefs were responsible for control of food production, decisions about village life and protection of the people from attackers. There were <em>turaga</em> at different levels ‚Äî a chief of the leading family of each village, a chief of a whole island, or a great chief (for example, the <em>Tui Lakeba</em>). These chiefs had the power of life and death over their people. In early times, the language used by commoners showed respect; one early greeting meant ‚ÄúEat me,‚Äù symbolising the chief‚Äôs power.</p>

        <p>At the same time, several <em>mataqali</em> who claimed a link to a common ancestor began to form <em>yavusa</em> or clans. As the population grew and competition increased for power and status, <em>yavusa</em> often joined together to form <strong>vanua</strong> (alliances). Later several <em>vanua</em> might join to form a larger political alliance, a <em>matanitu</em>. This organisation into <em>mataqali, yavusa, vanua</em> and <em>matanitu</em> was not exactly the same all over early Fiji, nor was it permanent. By 1800 there were twelve powerful <em>matanitu</em> led by great chiefs competing for power in Fiji.</p>

        <h2>What was early Fiji like?</h2>
        <p>From aerial photographs we can see that ring-ditches were also built in parts of Fiji like the Wailevu delta. The historian David Routledge suggests that these were built near the villages of powerful chiefs so that people escaping from wars in other districts could settle and enjoy the safety of a powerful neighbour.</p>

        <p>Fijians lived a life regularly threatened by war, but tending animals, fishing, ceremonies and domestic chores filled each day. Agriculture was particularly important. Fijians used wet-field methods to grow taro and protected the soil by leaving fields <strong>fallow</strong>.</p>

        <p>A further characteristic of early life was the practice of sacrifice. For ceremonial and spiritual reasons, people were used as rollers to launch huge war canoes or buried in the postholes of new buildings.</p>
