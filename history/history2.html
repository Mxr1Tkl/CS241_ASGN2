		<p>One of the problems facing Sir Arthur Gordon in 1875 was how Fiji could develop its economy in order to help
		it pay its way. The Imperial Government had given the colony a grant of ¬£100000, but when that was spent Fiji
		was expected to find its own finances.</p>
		<p>The answer obviously lay in the development of crops, especially cotton, copra and sugarcane, However, these
		were plantation crops hich required large amounts of labour. By this time, the import of Pacific labourers was 
		lessening as a result of the controls placed on it, and Gordon was firmly opposed to using Fijian labour. He argued
		that to do so would break up the village life of the Fijian people and undermine their whole communal way of living.</p>
		<p>Instead, Gordon recruited Indian labour, and thus changed the course of Fiji's future. Gordon's solution was not
		a new one, for Indian labour had been recruited for this type of work Natal in 1838 and subsequently in Trinidad,
		British Guiana, Mauritius and Dutch Guinea. Gordon's service in Trinidad and Mauritius, where the <strong>indenture</strong> system
		had worked satisfactorily, led him to believe hat Fiji would be no different. Gordon's desire not to disrupt the Fijian
		way S life was challenged by an opposite view which held that he Fijians would progress only when they were introduced
		to the modern world and changed to a way of life based on cash rather than communal living. Gordon's view prevailed, and
		the indenture system began.</p>
	<h2>Terms<em/></h2>

		<p>Arrangements were made in 1878 with the Indian Government for Indian labourers to be brought to Fiji for e period of
		five years. The labourers were to work as directed by the government, and were to be free to return to India at their own
		expense at the end of five years. If they elected to stay in Fiji for another five years, their return passages, as well as
		those of their children, would be paid by the Fiji Government. If they wished at the end of ten years to stay in Fiji, they
		could do so. </p>
		<p>The Indian Government insisted that for every hundred men sent to Fiji, forty women should also be sent. So, on 14 May 1879,
		the <em>Leonidas</em> landed the first shipload of 498 labourers from India.</p>
	<h2>Recruitment</h2>
		<p>Indians came to Fiji for a great variety of reasons. Poverty and the chance to make a fresh start were the greatest incentives,
		although some came to escape family quarrels or trouble with the authorities. Very few Indians came to Fiji simply because of a
		desire to emigrate. In fact, a journey across the seas meant a loss of caste membership for many Indians, and any journey involved
		expensive feasts and ceremonies of purification when the traveller returned to India.</p>
		<p>Labourers were engaged by subagents in India who received a commission for every labourer who reached Fiji. The main work was done
		by recruiters whose job was to explain the terms of the <strong>contract</strong> and to see that the emigrant was properly enrolled before a magistrate
		and had a thorough medical examination.</p>
		<p>It was difficult to break down the reluctance of Indians to travel, so many recruiters resorted to tricks in order to entice people
		to sign on: they exaggerated the fine prospects a labourer vould have in Fiji; they failed to explain all parts of the contract, especially
		that part which laid down a penalty if the labourer should not complete his contract; and they told those who feared the long sea journey
		that Fiji was very close to India, even that it was part of India itself! Altogether, over 60, 500 labourers were signed up.</p>
	<h2>The System in Practice</h2>
		<p>The labourers were housed in 'lines', rows of barracks containing sixteen rooms, each three metres by three and a half metres. These
		rooms were in double rows, eight in each row, with partitions which stopped short of the ceiling. Each room housed either three single men,
		or a married man and his wife with up to three children. All living, cooking, eating, and sleeping was carried out in this one room in which
		the inhabitants could not escape from the noise f their neighbours and where they could gain very little privacy. Because conditions were so
		overcrowded, life was very tough, and crime and immorality were soon widespread.</p>
		<img src="housing.jpg" alt="Labourers house in 'lines'" title="Labourers housing" width="400" height="300" />
		<p>The quota of forty women for every hundred men was not kept up. Rumours, accusations, jealousy and fighting were common. No provision
		was made for educating the children of the labourers, and checks on conditions by the government inspector were both infrequent and <strong>inadequate</strong>.
		There was also e lack of medical care, which resulted in a high death rate. The pressure of life on the lines was also illustrated by the large
		number of suicides which occurred.</p>
		<p>Work done in the fields varied according to the time of the year. The labourers cut cane during harvesting, and planted, weeded and
		cleared drains at other times. Work was often done on the 'task system' by which the workers' allocations for the day were measured out,
		and they were required to complete certain tasks before nightfall. I they failed, they would receive no wages for that day and were
		liable to be prosecuted. AS overseers and sardars (foreman) were usually paid a bonus if the work was done quickly and cheaply, 
		they tended to over-task the workers, setting tasks which could be completed only by the strongest. However, closer checks on the system
		after 1905 greatly reduced the amount of over-tasking.</p>
		<img src="labourers2.jpg" alt="Labourers" title="Labourers" width="400" height="300" />
		<p>Corporal punishment was often used in the field by overseers and sardars to extract the maximum amount of work, and most workers were
		afraid to report such abuse for fear of reprisals. Even when the government nspectors came, they seldom received true picture of working
		conditions because of such fear. When a complaint was lodged and it reached the courts, the workers were still at a disadvantage. They 
		understood little of the workings of the courts and were unable to match the legal aid available to the overseer or sardar. Most cases 
		in which a worker's plea was upheld saw a sentence imposed on the overseer or sardar which was often so light that true justice was seldom
		seen to be done.</p>
		<img src="labourers.jpg" alt="Labourers working" title="Labourers working" width="400" height="300" />
		<p>Because of the methods they used, sardars were frequently assaulted, Many laboufers also were prosecuted for failure to complete their
		tasks,and they were convicted in nearly every case.</p>
